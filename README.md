# Node.js - The simplest way to create a web server
In this project I use Node.js and Express module to create a simplest web server. 
The web server is listening on the port 3000 and will show you the "index.html" as hompage.
You can change the listening port editing the line "app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000)" and set 80 instead of 3000.
The directory "html" is important to place static web pages that won't be process as script page.
